This code controls the small orange robotic arm owned by ACN. 
The full instruction manual for the arm is here: https://www.adeept.com/learn/detail-67.html

This repository was forked from https://github.com/adeept/adeept_adr029/.
To easily see the changes, preview a PR to that repository. 

The reason for the initial changes was: 

- Joystick controls did not match those diagrammed in Lesson 8 of the Adeept documentation for servos 1 and 2. 
- Several of the console outputs for joystick control did not match the direction of the joystick movement. 

A version of this code is available on the arm raspberry pi in the office and can be accessed via `ssh` on our private network.
